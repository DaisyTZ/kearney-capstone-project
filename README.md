# Kearney Student Lab Capstone: Ad Strategy & Cost Optimization

## Project Overview

Our capstone consulting team partnered with a pet product company to address declining sales and rising operational costs. By using **advertising regression models**, **LSTM time series prediction**, and **scenario-based cost simulations**, we developed actionable recommendations to drive profitability.

We presented this project at the 2025 INFORMS Analytics+ Conference and won recognition for our analytical rigor and impact.

## Tech Stack
- Python (XGBoost, LSTM, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Tableau & PowerBI (for dashboarding)
- Pacvue & Profitero datasets
- Excel (Cost modeling)


## Modeling Highlights

### Ad Strategy Optimization
- Trained **regression models** to identify the most profitable ad categories
- Used historical ad performance data to forecast Return on Ad Spend (RoAS)
- Built **XGBoost + LSTM** models to predict clicks and sales
  - LSTM achieved R¬≤ = 0.68, outperforming other models

### Scenario-Based Production Modeling
- Compared 4 strategic options: Status Quo, Partial Outsourcing, Full Closure, and Hybrid
- Integrated costs, ad sales, and ROI for each option
- Recommended phased outsourcing to Southeast Asia for low-margin goods


## Key Insights
-  **Durable goods are essential** for maintaining sales of high-margin fast-moving goods
-  **Belgrove Street** station peaked Thursday 8 AM (from bundled modeling)
- Highest profitability came from reallocated ad budget to just 3 product categories
- Closing underutilized factories yields long-term financial gains if bundled with ad strategy


## Repository Structure
- `prentation`: Including poster for INFROMS and presentation slides
- `code `: Including two advertising optimization model and one cost-based scenario analysis
